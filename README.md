##Hey there,

👋 Welcome to "The Advisor" project! This is a small web application built using ReactJS that fetches and displays random advice from an API.

🤔 Are you feeling lost or unsure? Don't worry, I've got you covered. Here's a quick guide on how to get started with this project:

Install the necessary dependencies using npm install
Start the development server using npm start
Head over to http://localhost:3000 on your browser to see the application running
🚀 That's it, you're all set! The application is now up and running and you can explore it to your heart's content.

📝 If you'd like to make changes to the project, feel free to do so and submit a pull request. I'm always open to suggestions and feedback!
